/* 
    1. The first problem in the debugging process was displayed in line 3
 and indicate that arr1 is undefined

    2. For the debugging purpose I use visual studio debugging extension of node and breakpoint

    3. continue of the debugging process (after question 1)
     - once I put "," between the 2 arrays that I send to the function
     so it will  actually gets 2 arguments as it expects to
    - I changed the sum variable from 'const' to 'let' so it will be assignable
    - and lastly I add return it from the function, and put the call expression inside a console.log
